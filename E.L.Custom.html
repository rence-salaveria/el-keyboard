            <h2>Gasket Mount</h2>
            <p>
              A gasket mount uses gasket material between the plate and keyboard
              housing on both top and bottom sides. This gives the board a
              slightly more cushioned feel since the plate is not in direct
              contact with the other metal components of the keyboard.

              A less common mounting style that sandwiches the plate between the

              of typing feedback as well as a metallic sound depending on the
              plate material.

          <h2 class="Keyboard-Header-2">Mod the switches</h2>
          <p class="Modification-Description">
            Lubing the switches can be a good way to improve the sound quality
            and the feel of the linear and tactile switches. This process is a
            bit more time-consuming and requires more tools. Otherwise, you can
            purchase the pre-lubed switches so that you do not need to spend too
            much time doing them yourself. You can try filming switches as well.

        <div>
          <h2 class="Keyboard-Header-2">Mod the stabilizer</h2>
          <p class="Modification-Description">
            To enhance typing comfort and minimize stabilizer noise, three
            common methods are available: stabilizer clipping, lubrication, or
            the Band-Aid mod. Among these, lubrication has the most significant
            impact on stabilizer performance. Note that these mods may not be
            suitable for all stabilizer types. Prior to starting a project,
            consider exploring online video tutorials for further guidance

        <div>
          <h2 class="Keyboard-Header-2">Sound dampening</h2>
          <p class="Modification-Description">
            Sometimes the bottom case of the custom keyboard can sound hollow,
            and reverberate the switch ping when typing . This is most common
            with metal cases. Adding some soft material like sponge foam or
            fibers to the bottom case is an easy way to reduce the noise and
            hollowness inside a keyboard.
