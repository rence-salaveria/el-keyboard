            A custom keyboard is a personalized and often meticulously crafted
            keyboard designed by enthusiasts or professionals to cater to
            specific preferences in typing experience, aesthetics, and
            functionality. These keyboards deviate from standard off-the-shelf
            models, allowing users to tailor various aspects such as key
            switches, keycaps, layout, case design, and even lighting effects to
            suit their unique needs and style. Custom keyboards offer a highly
            customizable and often enhanced typing experience, appealing to
            individuals seeking a more personalized and ergonomic approach to
            their typing or gaming activities. They often involve a
            community-driven ecosystem, offering a range of components and
            resources to build, customize, and fine-tune keyboards to individual
            tastes.
